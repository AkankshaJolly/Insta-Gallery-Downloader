# Insta-Gallery-Downloader

I have always wanted a way to download all my images from instagram gallery to share/show it to others.

For some reason, Instagram has never allowed you to download images, even though you are the owner.
Yes, there's a feature that the image is downloaded when you upload, but what if you are on a different device ?
What if you never turned on the feature ?

There's no way to bulk download your images.

Presenting Instagram Gallery Downloader!
This is a bot to download all your instagram gallery pictures in a single folder. Simple as that. No strings attached.

Hopefully, you'll get more followers, increasing viewers of your feed. Keep reading to know how to get it up and going.

First off, you need to login to instagram and head over to www.instagram.com/developer 

1) Read simple instructions here -> http://www.slickremix.com/docs/how-to-create-instagram-access-token/

2) Watch the 2 min video, if step#1 is not clear -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkuJtIcXR68

3) Save the access token in config.txt file as:-

   access_token=newly generated token

   for ex:
   access_token=575199251.7in678i.g23atb436f6ba0fs8gi587f6a4esdcg3

   We need this access token to make requests to instagram.

4) And that's it, download the executable instaScrape_Sandbox.exe.

5) Place config.txt in the same folder as executable

6) Double click the .exe file, sit back, grab a beer, and let the script do its work.

All images of your feed will be present in Gallery folder created in the same directory.
Enjoy! :)
